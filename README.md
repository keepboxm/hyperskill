Here are some of my projects from Hyperskill 

## Coffee Machine project (Java) [Check at Hyperskill](https://hyperskill.org/projects/33?goal=7)

#### Stage 1/6: Hello, coffee!
Write a program that puts basic information on the screen: give the machine a chance to tell the customers what it’s doing!

#### Stage 2/6: Machines have needs
Program the machine to calculate the amount of ingredients it needs depending on how many people want some coffee.

#### Stage 3/6: Enough coffee for everyone
Working with conditions, program the machine to estimate how many creamy coffees it can make based on the amount of ingredients we enter.

#### Stage 4/6: Action!
Upgrade your knowledge of methods - set the machine to perform three basic actions: collect the money, renew the supplies, and serve the coffee.

#### Stage 5/6: On a coffee loop
Program the machine to display on the screen the amount of supplies left. Set the main loop: now the menu keeps updating until you press exit.

#### Stage 6/6: Brush your code
Time for some final touch-ups: structure the code so that it runs smoothly.
